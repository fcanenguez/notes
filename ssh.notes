# Make a CA using SSH for CA authentication

ssh-keygen -C CA -f ca

# -C = Comment for keys
# -f = file name for keys

# Sign a user's public key with CA private key to allow certificate authentication
ssh-keygen -s <path/to/CA/private/key> -I <ID_NAME> -Z <username> -z <serial#> /path/to/user/public/key

# This will create a *-cert.pub file which needs to be sent back to the original user
